What does the following program do?

- Reference -

setTimeout takes 2 parameters
- a callback function,
- a number that represents time in ms (miliseconds) after which to execute the callback
setTimeout returns a number representing the id of the timeout, used to clear the timeout e.g. clearTimeout(id)

- Problem -

function g() {
    console.log("Hello!")
}

function f() {
    setTimeout(g, 500);
}

function h() {
    setTimeout(f, 1000);
}

setTimeout(h, 200); 
//Firt, it is going to wait 200ms to call h, then h is going to execute and wait 1000ms to call f, 
//then f is going to execute and wait 500ms to call g which inmediatelly is going to console.log "hello!"

//After 1700miliseconds (1.7s) the program is going to console.log "Hello!"
